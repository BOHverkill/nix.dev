How do we collaborate on the documentation team?

- Discussion should happen on pull requests directly
- Meeting agendas are submitted as pull requests
- Questions are posted on Discourse
- Proposals are opened as pull requests on GitHub
- How to create a meeting protocol:
    - Merge pull request with agenda for current meeting
    - Merge pull requests made on last session
    - Work on the agenda
    - Submit pull request(s) with meeting results
    - Post links to submitted pull requests on Discourse
    - Update calendar/invitations
