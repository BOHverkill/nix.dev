### Writing style

Describe the subject factually.
Use imperative in direct instructions.

Clarity and brevity outweighs emotional appeal.
Do not presuppose a personal relationship with readers.

Address the reader with "you" when necessary.
Clarify identity if you use "we".
Generally, "we" are the Nix community and, more specifically, nix.dev authors.
