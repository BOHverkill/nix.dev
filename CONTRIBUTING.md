### Writing style

Describe the subject factually.
Use imperative in direct instructions.

Clarity and brevity outweighs emotional appeal.
Do not presuppose a personal relationship with readers.

Address the reader with "you" when necessary.
Clarify identity if you use "we".
Generally, "we" are the Nix community and, more specifically, nix.dev authors.

Use culturally neutral language:

- Avoid idioms.

  Idioms can be hard to understand for non-native English speakers.

- Do not try to be funny.

  Humor is highly culturally sensitive.
  At best, jokes may obfuscate the relevant instructions.
  At worst, jokes may offend readers and invalidate our effort to help them learn.

- Do not use references to popular culture.

  What you may consider well-known may be entirely obscure and distracting to people from different backgrounds.
