# How to get help

If you need assistance with one of your contributions, there are a few places you
can go for help.

For better efficiency and chances of success, you should try to contact individuals or groups with more specific knowledge first:
  - look for the relevant package's maintainers, listed in its `maintainers` attribute
  - look at the git log for the relevant files
  - check out if any teams are responsible for the relevant subsystem:
    - on the [NixOS website](https://nixos.org/community/#governance-teams)
    - in the [team list file](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/maintainers/team-list.nix)
    - in the [`CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS) file

If that fails, you can resort to asking the community at large, using one of the official
communication channels, such as:
  - a related room in the [NixOS Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#community:nixos.org)
  - the *Help* category on the [Discourse Forum](https://discourse.nixos.org/c/learn/9)
    - note that people typically (but not always!) have the same username here as on
      GitHub, so this can be another way of reaching out to specific maintainers.
  - the general [`#nix`](https://matrix.to/#/#nix:nixos.org) room on Matrix

If your issue is about a specific package, or a subsystem as listed in `CODEOWNERS`, then file an issue on nixpkgs, and tag the
maintainers.

If it's a more general question, rather than an issue, ask on Matrix or on Discourse.
